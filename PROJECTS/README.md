This folder contains small front-end projects built with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you prefer, rename this README to "Frontend Projects README" to reflect that these are not MERN apps.

Projects
- Birthday Project — simple static CRUD UI (localStorage) for birthday reminders.
- Leads Tracker — front-end leads capture form and UI (no backend).
- Personal Webpage — React-free portfolio built with HTML/CSS/vanilla JS.
- Space Exploration — demo visualizations using public space APIs (client-only).

Contributing
- Open issues or submit PRs for fixes, features, or accessibility improvements.
- Keep CSS and JS modular; document any changes to file structure in the project README.

License
- Default to MIT unless a different license file is present in a specific project.
- Update per-project LICENSE files as needed.
