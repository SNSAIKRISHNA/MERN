## About

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.


### Key Concepts

> [!NOTE]
> - **Endpoints**: Specific URLs where API requests are sent
> - **HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
> - **Request/Response**: Client sends a request, server returns a response
> - **Data Format**: Typically JSON or XML

## REQUEST :  ##
  : When a device asks for a " resourse" (data, image, html page, authentication token, etc)
  : Requires a connection to the internet somehow

## RESPONSE :  ##
  : The reply  to the request
  : could contain the resource (HTML, JSON, data, etc..)
  : Could contain a response saying the client isn't authorized to receive the resource

### Common Uses

- Retrieving data from a server
- Sending data to be processed or stored
- Integrating third-party services
- Building microservices architecture
